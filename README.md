# Teachable-Machine
Inspired from the https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ I tried to do this project in python. The CNN architecture used in this is MobileNet which is already available in the Tensorflow. Transfer learning is used to recalibarate the output layer to classify new images on the go.

To Do:
1. Add requirements.
2. Try YOLO
